# Remotely_Piloted_Drone
Goal of this project is to make a simple to use virtual shell that can control a drone used for survelliance and boundary mapping.
The primary feature of this application is that is does not require the user to have Drone-kit or pymavlink on board. It operates on just text based commands and can be used from pretty much a lemon of a machine.

# Integration With Unreal Engine
This project is also integrated with UE4 to create a 3D simulation of what the APIs are capable of.

# Reinforcement Learning with Tensorflow and Airsim
With the help of reinforcement learning using tf, the RPA can be taught to follow a given line and avoid obstacles.
